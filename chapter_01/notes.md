## Chapter 1 - Just a... whirl of wind
### (The Semantics of TLA+ and PlusCal)
  

Basically, we're going to start writing up an algorithm to send money from one bank account to another.
We'll leave a flaw in so that TLA+ has something to do.

A few spec notes:
- The name of a TLA+ module _needs_ to match the filename. Otherwise, TLA+ will consider the spec invalid.
- Anything above the dashes (`----`) and below the equals signs (`====`) are ignored
